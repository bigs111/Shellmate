4. Now you want to copy that file to do this type "cp <file name> /usr/local/bin/<file name>
5. Next type in "nano ~/.bashrc" now scroll all the way to the bottom and type this : alias shellmate="/usr/local/bin/<name of file>" this allows you to create a alias for this script basically it allows you to type "shellmate" into the console to excute the script instead of typing "shellmate1.0.sh" just makes it a little easier. 
6. Now type "source ~/.bashrc" into the terminal.
